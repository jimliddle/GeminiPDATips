# Gemini PDA Tips

## Software

### Email

**K-9 Mail** - The default K-9 mail is a little too unpolished for me. I have it setup but I find that I don't use it. The main reason is that as part of my mobile workflow I like to see the sent emails in the unified view and there seems no way to achieve this with K9. Also I still like to swipe to delete and this also seems missing from K9.

**BlackBerry Hub**- This works really well on the Hub, even in Lanscape mode. It does work with Key combinations like the K9 the overall experience is good. Emails are marked as read when read on other devices. Sent emails can be viewed in the Hub view and it also provide a single place to see interacitons from other social services.

### Calendar

**Default Calendar** - The default Calendar is really not nice and simply not fit for purpose on a device such as this

**aCalendar+** - Works really well in Landscape. The view reminds me of an old Palm Calendar called DateBk6 (this is actually available on Android in a different incarnation called Pimlical, but the user experience was not good). aCalendar works really well on the Gemini PDA and will more than suffice until Planet release their own dedicated App.
