# Gemini PDA Tips

## Hardware

### Notifications

**Pebble 2 Watch** I use a Pebble 2 watch for notifications. It works great with the Gemini and also has apps that enable dial without opening the device etc. 

**Sony SBH54 headset** Additionally the Sony [SBH54 bluetooth headset](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-Stereo-Smart-Bluetooth-Headset-Black/dp/B0154G9CYY) (actually just calling it a headset does it an injustice). It provides a great way to recieve and interact with not only phone calls but also receive messages from the Gemini, and you can use it as a portable handset to take and make phone calls.

### Brightness

**High Brightness** I have been spolit with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and its extra high brightness in sunlight. The Gemini is not as good in direct sunlight but I found an App called [High Brightness Mode](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=flar2.hbmwidget&hl=en_US) that triggers an extra high brightness mode that is built in to many phones. I tried it and it works well with the Gemini and it ups the nits.

Simiarily I find the automated brightness control all over the place, particularly with regards to dimming. Again there is an App that can solve this problem called [WellBrightness](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.a30corner.wellbrightness_paid&hl=en_GB)

## Software

### Email

**K-9 Mail** - The default K-9 mail is a little too unpolished for me. I have it setup but I find that I don't use it. The main reason is that as part of my mobile workflow I like to see the sent emails in the unified view and there seems no way to achieve this with K9. Also I still like to swipe to delete and this also seems missing from K9.

**BlackBerry Hub**- This works really well on the Hub, even in Lanscape mode. It does work with Key combinations like the K9 the overall experience is good. Emails are marked as read when read on other devices. Sent emails can be viewed in the Hub view and it also provide a single place to see interacitons from other social services.

Keys that work as shortcuts in App include: 

**c** - compose; <br/> 
**s** - Search; <br/> 
**r** - Reply; <br/>
**a** - Reply all; <br/>
**n** Calendar view in-app if BlackBerry Calendar is installed

### Launcher

**BlackBerry Launcher** - I use the [BlackBerry Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackberry.blackberrylauncher). It enables keys to be used to launch Apps but on single press and long press. Note however that you need use [Screen Rotation Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bong.android.androidlock) with it to ensure it works in Landacape mode. In fact you should use Screen Rotation Control anyway to force any Apps that won't work in landscape mode to work.

### Calendar

**Default Calendar** - The default Calendar is really not nice and simply not fit for purpose on a device such as this

**aCalendar+** - Works really well in Landscape. The view reminds me of an old Palm Calendar called DateBk6 (this is actually available on Android in a different incarnation called Pimlical, but the user experience was not good). aCalendar works really well on the Gemini PDA and will more than suffice until Planet release their own dedicated App.

**CalenGoo** - Looks decent but at this point I have not tried it

**Gemini Agenda App** - Font resolution does not work well with  Big Font so I don't use it.

### Browser

**Chrome** The default Chrome browser works well and you can use a list of shortcuts from the keyboard to work with it:

Ctrl + T / ctrl + N	Open new tab / open N ew T ab <br/>
Ctrl + W	Close the current tab / close W indow <br/>
Ctrl + Tab	To the next tab / next T ab <br/>
Ctrl + Shift + Tab	To previous tab / previous T ab <br/>
Ctrl + Go to the nth tab from the left / go to N o. Tab <br/>
Ctrl + L	Go to the address bar / go to L ocation bar <br/>
Ctrl + R	Reload page / R eload page <br/>
Ctrl + F	Search within the page / F ind word <br/>
Alt + ←	Back to the previous page / previous page <br/>
Alt + →	Go to the next page / next page <br/>

**Firefox Focus** This also works well and I tend to use it with Orbot VPN for a privacy focused browser that I can launch as and when I choose. 

**Dolphin Browser** A nice browser with lots of plugins. The full screen mode probably offers the most screen estate from any of the browsers.

**Samsung Internet Browser** - Awesome simply for the night mode and the readability capability in the last release.

**Microsoft Edge** - Another solid browser for Android with a good readability capability

### Note Taking Apps

**Built in Gemini Note taking App** - Works well enough 

**Google Keep** - works nicely and also works with the silver assists button for autoamted note taking. Say “Ok Google” to invoke Google Assistant. Now, ask it to “take notes”.[link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep)

**IAWriter** - Works well and has good Markdown support. [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep). 

**QuickEdit** - A nice App. Good Syntax editing for code and has built in cloud supports, including FTP/FTPS/SFTP that plays nicely with the Storage Made Easy File Fabric.[link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhmsoft.edit)

**SimpleNote** - One of the first Apps I install. Works nicely on the Gemini. [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.automattic.simplenote)

**Evernote** - Solid and works well in Landscape mode.[link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evernote)

### Notification Apps

**GeminiLED** - Developed specfiically for the Gemini. Very cool App that changes the coloured state of the Notification LED's based on what App you assign (and what colour you assign to that App). [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=harby.graham.geminiled)
